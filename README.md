## Project Description
The Internet of Things (IoT) has lead to a boom in big data sets.  For this 
purposes of this project, we have been asked to produce a tidy dataset of
the physical activity camptured by Samsung Galaxy S III smartphones.  The
data are then manipulated to produce the tidy data set.

##Study design and data processing
rStudio has been used to create the tidy dat set.  The function run_analysis.r
has been produced to accomplish this task.  

###Collection of the raw data

data whieh is then stored on a cloud server, allowing for the querying of these
data.
